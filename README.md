README
======================

In this repository you will find two files, a run_analysis.R script and the CodeBook that describes output data from the script, which is a tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
run_analysis.R works on a dataset which should be downloaded and unzipped.

To use the script follow the steps:

1. Download [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) dataset
2. Extract data
3. Set working directory in *UCI HAR Dataset* folder
 
Output of this script will be two datasets named "tidyData.txt" and "averageData.txt" stored in the working directory.
The variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data are described in the CodeBook.md
